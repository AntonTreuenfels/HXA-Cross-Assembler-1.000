        .errfile

#        .maxwarn    $1000   ; we'll get lots of these... (no we won't! - HXA 1.00)

; -------------------------------

        .cpu    "T_16_L"    ; required psop
        .org    $1000       ; we'll use implicit segments (the default)

; -------------------------------

; implicit segments are unnamed, so we can deliberately generate enough of
; them to reach the limit without a whole lot of trouble

; a discontinuous program counter by itself does not create a new segment
; because what matters is non-consective data storage

        .echo   "No data storage"

        .repeat $800
        .ds 0
        .ds 2
        .endr

; we can change the program counter as often as we want without creating
; a new segment as long as data storage is continuous

#        .echo   "No discontinuous data storage"

#        .repeat $800
#        .word   *
#        .ds     -2        ; HXA 1.00 never allows negative values for 'DS
#        .ds     2
#        .endr

; discontinuous data storage is what creates new implicit segments

        .echo   "Discontinuous data storage"

        .repeat $800
        .word   *           ; current version allows 1023 segments
        .ds     2
        .endr
