; this test is meant to show that it is not guaranteed that simply
; examining a base file name proves it has or has not been read before
; - the test requires duplicate copies of this file in two directories
; - because the paths are different the files may in fact be different
; - because the base filenames are the same the files might be the same
; - the assembler does not know which is the case, so it simply warns
; and goes ahead with the inclusion

;        .org    $1000       ; un-required psop

; try reading what might be a different file (but only once)

; stop "END" from terminating processing at end of duplicate file
