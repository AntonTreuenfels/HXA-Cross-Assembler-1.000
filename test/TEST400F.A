        .cpu    "T_16_L"    ; required psop
        .org    $1000       ; required psop

label1  .ds     256         ; label1 = $1000

; why not allow negative values for "DS" ?
; - well there's no real logical contradiction involved,
; since we can simply say the program counter is decremented
; - it would be essentially the same thing as:

label2   =      *           ; label2 = $1100
        .org    * - 256

; but (1) it's not necessary since we can do the above if we really want to,
; and (2) it's simpler programming of the assembler if we rule it out,
; and (3) a segmented program can't accept negative values anyway

; might as well test this as long as we're here:
; branch target label legal but odd

 +      .ds     256         ; autolabel = $0F00
