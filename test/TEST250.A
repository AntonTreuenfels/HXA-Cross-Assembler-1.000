; 'if' and 'include' blocks will be intertwined on block stack

; if we use the "END" psop at the end of this file, it will be executed
; the first time the conditional block is completed. That's not what we
; want, though, since the block has to complete about 127 more times
; before the include stack is completely unwound. Fortunately "END" is
; not a required psop because its effects happen automatically at the
; end of source anyway.
