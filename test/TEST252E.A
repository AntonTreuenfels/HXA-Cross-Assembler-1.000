; -------------------------------

; this output file will have the same name as the included input file
; - output files cannot have the same name as any input file
; - but it won't be detected until output time because it is named
; before the include file is
; - error message refers to the last line of source
; - so can be confusing, but this is likely a very rare error

        .if defined( INCTEST )      ; not defined the first time encountered (so skips everything)

        .listfile                   ; stored in directory test, not testhelp (which is what we want)
