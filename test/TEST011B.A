; this will create list and object files in the current working directory
; - of whatever device is specified
; the point of this test is to copy this file to another device
; and see if HXA can find it
; - must invoke from command line using device name
; -- point being that name is NOT relative to current working directory on this device
; -- it is actually relative to the current working directory on the OTHER device
; - try absolute and relative paths on other device
; - eg., if the current working directory on G: is code, try G:filename, G:\code\filename
