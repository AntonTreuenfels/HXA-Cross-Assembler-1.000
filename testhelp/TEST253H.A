; -------------------------------

; this test is meant to show that it is not guaranteed that a file
; has not previously been read simply by examining the base filename
; - the test requires duplicate copies of this file in two directories
; - because the paths are different the files may in fact be different
; - because the base filenames are the same the files might be the same
; - the assembler does not know which is the case, so it simply warns
; and puts the new (full) name on the "do not read again" list

; -------------------------------

;        .cpu    "T_16_M"    ; un-required psop
;        .org    $1000       ; un-required psop

; -------------------------------

        .echo "Before READONCE in " + dir$()

; prohibit a second read of either file
; - placed before any inclusions, the current file name
; is added to the "do not read again" list here
; - "test253h.a" has put nothing on the include file stack or in files read list
; - "..\testhelp\test253h.a" has "testhelp253h.a" for both stack and list,
; but only the list is actually checked (so only one warning)

        .readonce           ; "..\testhelp\test253h.a" warns here

        .echo "After READONCE in " + dir$()

; show that a second read of the current file doesn't happen
; - "test253h.a" includes "test253h.a" (silently fails)
; - "..\testhelp\test253h.a" includes "..\testhelp\test253h.a" (silently fails)

        .echo "Trying to self-include " + dir$() + "\\" + file$()
        .include file$()
        .echo "Included " + dir$() + "\\" + file$()

; try reading what might be a different file
; - "test253h.a" includes "testhelp\test253h.a" (succeeds)
; - "testhelp\test253h.a" includes "testhelp\test253h.a" (silently fails)

        .echo "Trying to include another file with the same basename"
        .include "..\\testhelp\\test253h.a"
        .echo "Included " + dir$() + "\\" + file$()

; -------------------------------

; stop "END" from terminating processing at end of duplicate file
